              Bollywood actor Salman Khan's clothing brand "Being Human" finally 
              entered the Bangladeshi market on Thursday with its outlet launching 
              in the capital‚Äôs Banani area.
              His brother and actor Sohail Khan, along with CEO of Being Human Clothing 
              Sanjeev Rao attended the launching ceremony of the very first outlet of the 
              franchise in the country.
              ‚ÄúOur family started the (Being Human) Foundation as a means to help spread a 
              good message centered on humanism and charity, which has slowly evolved over 
              the years with brands emerging under the cause,‚Äù Sohail told the media at the 
              launching ceremony.‚ÄúEvery time you purchase something from this outlet a part 
              of it will directly go into impacting lives of the underprivileged,‚Äù he further said.
              The local franchisees of the clothing brand, which has become a popular choice for youth 
              in India, are Rehan Rahman and Mohaimin Mostafa, who are also co-owners of Crimson Cup 
              Bangladesh and several other ventures.
              Salehin F Nahian, director of leading construction firm Fakhor Uddin Brothers and the Sylhet 
              Chamber of Commerce and Industries, is also a co-owner of the franchise. 
              ‚ÄúWe are bringing the franchise because we feel there is huge demand for an international clothing
              brand in Bangladesh,‚Äù one of the franchisees told Dhaka Tribune.
              According to him, there is a huge fan base of Salman Khan in Bangladesh and the brand‚Äôs international 
              quality products are likely to be welcomed by both the fashion and fan following.</p>

              Sylhet is one of the most developed cities in South 
              Asian country Bangladesh. Sylhet is well famous for 
              exporting quality tea all over the world and also known 
              as the Land of Tea Gardens. This city is also well known 
              as Second London because many locals well settled in London 
              and they always contribute a lot to develop their city.

              Sylhet still carries many spiritual values to all. It became Holy 
              Land when famous Sufi Hazrat Shah Jalal (R) came here for the first
              time with 360 saints to spread Islam.
              Though Bengali is the primary spoken language everywhere in Bangladesh 
              in Sylhet, locals find comfort talking in their language (Sylheti Bengali). 
              You can communicate in English too.

              There are many standard hotels, and resorts from budget to luxury in Sylhet to stay. 
              Many good restaurants are there to taste all types of cuisines. But Bengali cuisines 
              are must-try for all.

            <p>
              On June 2010 Ronaldo became the fourth footballer ever to have a wax statue at the Madame Tussauds museum in London.
              In his hometown there is a museum, Museu CR7 which is dedicated only to Ronaldo containing his trophies, medals, rare 
              pictures and everything related to Ronaldo.
              Ronaldo was doubtful about wearing the Number 7 shirt because he thought it would be too much pressure on him as the 
              number 7 shirt was worn by legends like Johnny Berry, Eric Cantona and David Beckham. After wearing it, he was forced 
              to live up to the number.
              Ronaldo donates blood regularly and does not smoke or have any tattoos on his body.
              Ronaldo has won the FIFA world player of the year award, Ballon d‚ÄôOr, the Golden Boot, and has been named the UEFA Club 
              Forward of the Year as well.
              Ronaldo also has a fashion boutique named CR7 and models for men‚Äôs fashion wear. The store is famous for featuring diamond
              studded clothing.
              He is rich and famous but is always involved with charity, fund raising and donations to NGOs. He has funded schools in 
              Gaza and also acts as the Ambassador to Save the Children and The Mangrove Care Forum in Indonesia.
